### Abstract:   
This is the classic game of tic-tac-toe that we all know and love but designed with a cat and mouse theme. It is a two player game so you and a friend can play togeher in person and solve the age old question of boredom. With the click of a button, users can add their tokens and allow the game to switch between the players, calculate their scores and display whose turn it is automatically.  
### Installation Instructions:

- Git clone this repo to your local machine by copy and pasting the clone link into your terminal
- Cd into that directory
- Enter the command open index.html to open the browser
- Have fun playing a classic game with a friend!

### Context:  

Final solo project for mod 1 done in a week. It took me over 40 hours to complete as a mod 1 student. 

### Contributors:  
Application built entirely by [Deanna Sofia Stevens](https://github.com/dsstevens)

### Learning Goals:

Solidify and demonstrate my understanding of: 
 - DRY JavaScript
 - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
 - Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
 - Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
 - Use your problem solving process to break down large problems and solve things step by step

### Wins + Challenges:  
 - Learning more about a11y by downloading the wave tool and ensuring the styling and rendering of the project is as accessible as possible.  
 - Creating a good git work flow and successfully working on branches to add features.  
 - Working with personal health issues while staying dedicated to the project and putting the hours in.
 - Both a challenge and a win: choosing to use divs to create the gameboard and manipulating the divs to flex into the grid. Using on click events on divs vs using buttons and in hindsight would do it differently.  
 - Through determining winning combos and square ids and how to calculate a win, I learned about the Object.keys method and split methods.
 - Writing the checkForWin function and working to refactor it to be simpler with less conditionals.
 - Thinking through branching conditional logic for gameplay and how to keep functions separate to avoid unwanted behavior from "chaining" functions inside of each other but thinking through the functionality sequentially.
 - Learning how to use setTimeout properly without invoking the function automatically.
 - Creating a nested object as a data model has its pros and cons. I exercised my bracket notation and data digging into the properties.
 - Developing a good javascript workflow on my own. A big challenge that I have learned from is to aim for functionality first then refactor. I programmed while refactoring which created a confusing workflow for myself. I still would like to refactor the player objects to be created by a function rather than given nested objects.
 - Refactoring in general has given me a lot of lessons with this project and at the moment, there is still room for improvement i.e. with the DOM displaying functions which could be made into a single toggling innerHTML function for the game state banner.
